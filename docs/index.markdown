# Azure OpenAI API Hands-on LevelUp Labs

Welcome to the **Azure OpenAI API Hands-on LevelUp Labs** repository! This repository contains three hands-on labs that will help you build intelligent applications using OpenAI API.

## Lab 1: Book Creator Sample Learning App

This lab demonstrates how to use the [semantic kernel](https://github.com/microsoft/semantic-kernel) framework to integrate OpenAI's Large Language Models (LLMs) with conventional programming languages. You will learn how to build an intelligent book creator app that can generate new content based on existing text.

## Lab 2: ChatGPT + Enterprise Data with OpenAI and Azure Cognitive Search
This lab shows how to use Azure OpenAI Service to access the ChatGPT model (gpt-35-turbo) and Azure Cognitive Search for data indexing and retrieval. You will learn how to build a chatbot that can answer questions using enterprise data.

## Lab 3: Transaction Classification Application

This lab demonstrates how to classify transaction records using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model and Azure Storage, Azure Event Grid, and Azure Function services. You will learn how to build an intelligent transaction classification app that can automatically categorize financial transactions.

## Getting Started

To get started with these labs, you will need to have an Azure OpenAI API key and access to Azure services. Please follow the instructions in [pre-req](./modules/Module0/prereq.md) file to set up the necessary environment and dependencies
