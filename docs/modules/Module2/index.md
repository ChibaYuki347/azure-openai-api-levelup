## Module 2 - Transaction Classification Application
This is a tutorial project that demonstrates how to integrate Azure OpenAI API with Azure services to build intelligent applications. Specifically, it shows how to classify transaction records using OpenAI's GPT-3 language model and Azure Storage, Azure Event Grid and Azure Function services.

The intent is to classify a public dataset of transactions into a number of categories that we have predefined. These approaches should be replicable to any multiclass classificaiton use case where we are trying to fit transactional data into predefined categories, and by the end of running through this you should have an approach for dealing with unlabelled datasets.
